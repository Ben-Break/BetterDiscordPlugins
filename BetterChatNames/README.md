Thanks to [Niemiets](https://github.com/Niemiets) for the inspiration with their plugin [DashToSpaceInChannelName](https://github.com/Niemiets/BD_Plugins/tree/main/DashToSpaceInChannelName), and [DaSussy](https://github.com/DaSussy) *(great name btw lol)* for the code I based this off. If you have any suggestions, even just for cleaning the code, feel free to let me know
