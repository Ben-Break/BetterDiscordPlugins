Thanks to [Niemiets](https://github.com/Niemiets) for the inspiration with their plugin [DashToSpaceInChannelName](https://github.com/Niemiets/BD_Plugins/tree/main/DashToSpaceInChannelName), and [DaSussy](https://github.com/DaSussy) for the code I based this off (but obviously heavily edited). If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know!
